    <h1>High Resoltion Zelda Maps</h1>
    <p>
      All images have a resolution of 24064 x 18944. Credit to <a href="https://zeldamods.org">zeldamods.org</a> for the source.
      These were generated with a program I made that scraped the several thousand max-zoom
      images from each game's interactive map on the site. I then stitched them together into
      a single large image. Be warned, opening any of these images in your browser may use
      over 6 GB of RAM while rendering before dropping back down to a reasonable level.
      Depending on how you plan to use this, it may be worth it to convert these to PNGs,
      which use only around 300 MB over the idle level. This 300 MB will stick around, unlike
      the AVIFs, likely due to the size being 30 times larger. I do have PNG versions, but I'm
      still considering how to host them, as Github doesn't seem to like the 300 MB file size.
