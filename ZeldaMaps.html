    <h1>High Resoltion Zelda Maps</h1>
    <p>
      All images have a resolution of 24064 x 18944. Credit to <a href="https://zeldamods.org>zeldamods.org</a> for the source.
      These were generated with a program I made that scraped the several thousand max-zoom
      images from each game's interactive map on the site. I then stitched them together into
      a single large image. The PNGs have been optimized on the max compression settings. I
      got the AVIFs by exporting using GIMP, so I'm not sure how optimized they are. Both have
      some compression artifacts due to the source being WEBP images.
